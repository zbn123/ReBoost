Description: Boosting methods for standard and imbalanced regression tasks. Boosting is a subsampling ensemble method based on the idea that it is possible to convert a weak learning algorithm (that performs slightly better than a random predictor) into one that is able to achieve high accuracy. Regardless of its proven relevance in classification problems, there are a few proposals of boosting for regression tasks. This package groups some of these proposals and provides a variants incorporating resampling strategies for each of them to tackle imbalanced regression tasks - prediction of extreme values.
