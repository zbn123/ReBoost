\title{Class ''AdaBoost''}
\description{
\strong{AdaBoost} is a class of objects containing information that describes a boosting model for regression tasks.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{model}}{A set of decision trees corresponding to the number of boosting iterations}

\item{\code{form}}{A formula describing the prediction problem}

\item{\code{modeltype}}{Type of boosting method. This packages implements 5 different proposals:
\describe{
\item{\strong{R2}}{AdaBoost.R2 proposed by Drucker (1997).}
\item{\strong{BEM}}{BEMBoost proposed by Feely (2000).}
\item{\strong{RT}}{AdaBoost.RT proposed by Solomatine and Shrestha (2004).}
\item{\strong{RTPlus}}{AdaBoost+ proposed by Kankanala et al. (2014).}
\item{\strong{RQ}}{AdaBoost.RQ proposed by package authors (publication in progress). Nutshell: uses the median of errors as a dynamic threshold.}
}}

\item{\code{model_pars}}{A list with available parameters in creating decision trees and guiding the boosting process. Each boosting method allows for different parameters, which are detailed as follows:
\describe{
\item{\strong{For AdaBoost.R2}}{
\strong{niter}, the number of boosting iterations;
\strong{power} Exponent used to calculate the weight of each decision tree. Common values are 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic, default), 3 (cubic).
}
\item{\strong{For BEMBoost}}{
\strong{niter}, the number of boosting iterations;
\strong{BEM}, the Big Error Margin: a value that defines which errors (absolute distance) should be considered as being big.
}
\item{\strong{For AdaBoost.RT}}{
\strong{niter}, the number of boosting iterations;
\strong{thr}, absolute relative error threshold used to define prediction cases as hard to predict;
\strong{power}, exponent used to calculate the weight of each decision tree. Common values are 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic, default), 3 (cubic).
}
\item{\strong{For AdaBoost+}}{
\strong{niter}, the number of boosting iterations;
\strong{thr}, absolute relative error threshold used to define prediction cases as hard to predict;
\strong{power} Exponent used to calculate the weight of each decision tree. Common values are 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic, default), 3 (cubic);
\strong{sigma}, value used for regularization (default 0.5). If no regularization is expected, use NULL.
}
\item{\strong{For AdaBoost.RQ}}{
\strong{niter}, the number of boosting iterations;
\strong{power} Exponent used to calculate the weight of each decision tree. Common values are 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic, default), 3 (cubic).
